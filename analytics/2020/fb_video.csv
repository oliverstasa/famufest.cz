Někdo se uchyloval do hlubin ledničky, k randění sám se sebou a pizzou - podobně jako Antonie. Někdo šel zase ve stopách Matěje a zaháněl smutek za zvuku zenové hudby volající k večerní józe. Tomu je naštěstí konec a první den FAMUFESTU je konečně tady a s ním i zahajovací video s moderátory letošního ročníku Antonií Formanovou a Matějem Šumberou! 👇🏻🎥

Even we stressed. Each of us in a different way. Some of us were seeking comfort in the deep corners of the refrigerator, some decided to spend some quality time with oneself and a pizza - a bit like Antonie. Others took a similar route as Matěj and escaped sadness drawn by the sounds of zen music that was inviting to an evening of yoga. But that is in the past and the first day of FAMUFEST has finally arrived and with it an opening video with this year's festival presenters Antonie Formanová and Matěj Šumbera.",Video,,,"05/20/2020 09:00:09 AM"," "," ",,1,,12818,12116,4059,3702,1207,1056,548,502,923,804,3762,297,992,215,437,111,0,12818,0,4059,0,1207,0,548,0.9658,0.7126,0.4077,0.2844,0.2329,0.2083,0.1783,0.1613,0.1456,0.1332,0.1238,0.1152,0.1083,0.102,0.0949,0.0715,0.0687,0.0665,0.0657,0.0629,0.0619,0.0604,0.0586,0.0594,0.0576,0.0548,0.055,0.0545,0.0553,0.054,0.0528,0.0525,0.0512,0.0525,0.0507,0.0505,0.05,0.0492,0.0497,0.0368,0.0277,0.9674,0.7056,0.3921,0.2637,0.212,0.1891,0.1601,0.142,0.1256,0.1146,0.1045,0.096,0.0897,0.0854,0.0799,0.0591,0.0555,0.0544,0.0539,0.0517,0.0509,0.0495,0.0473,0.0479,0.0465,0.0449,0.0449,0.0451,0.0454,0.0443,0.0424,0.0416,0.0413,0.0424,0.041,0.0408,0.0402,0.0394,0.0399,0.0306,0.0235,0.9443,0.8014,0.6063,0.547,0.4983,0.453,0.4111,0.4077,0.4007,0.3693,0.3693,0.3589,0.3449,0.3136,0.2857,0.23,0.2369,0.2195,0.216,0.2056,0.2021,0.1986,0.2021,0.2056,0.1986,0.1812,0.1847,0.1742,0.1812,0.1777,0.1847,0.1916,0.1777,0.1812,0.1742,0.1742,0.1742,0.1742,0.1742,0.115,0.0801,332,,1031,,281,,692,,6,280,10,6,255,10
